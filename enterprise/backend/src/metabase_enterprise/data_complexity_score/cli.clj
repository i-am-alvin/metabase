(ns metabase-enterprise.data-complexity-score.cli
  "CLI entrypoint for computing the data complexity score.

  Two source modes:

    `--source representation` (default) — scores an on-disk serdes export. No appdb required
       unless `--write-to-appdb true` is also requested.

    `--source appdb` — scores entities read directly from the application DB via raw JDBC,
       deliberately bypassing the Toucan model layer that the cron and API use. Intended to
       stay safe even when a newer Metabase binary is pointed at an older appdb (e.g. a v73 CLI
       sampling a v54 appdb to compute a comparative score) — see
       [[metabase-enterprise.data-complexity-score.appdb-source]] for the isolation contract and
       the scope reductions it implies (no synonym-axis, no `:metabot` catalog, no Snowplow, no
       fingerprint advance).

  Persistence is controlled independently by `--write-to-appdb`. The default tracks the source:
  true in appdb mode, false in representation mode. Both can be overridden explicitly. Whether
  or not we persist, no read or write here goes through Toucan — the only DB mutation this CLI
  is ever capable of is the single `INSERT INTO data_complexity_score` performed by
  [[metabase-enterprise.data-complexity-score.appdb-source/record-score!]].

  Two invocation styles:

    Dev (classpath, no AOT):
      clojure -M:ee:dev -m metabase-enterprise.data-complexity-score.cli --source appdb
      clojure -M:ee:dev -m metabase-enterprise.data-complexity-score.cli \\
        --source representation -r path/to/fixture/

    AOT JAR (via `metabase.core.bootstrap`):
      java -jar metabase.jar --mode complexity-score --source appdb
      java -jar metabase.jar --mode complexity-score \\
        --source representation -r path/to/fixture/

  Patterned after [[metabase-enterprise.checker.cli]] — same `fail!` pattern, same arg style,
  and the same bootstrap-dispatched [[entrypoint]] hook."
